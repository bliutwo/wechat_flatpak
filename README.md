# Attempt to Install WeChat on Linux

So I want to figure out how to install WeChat on Linux because one giant pain in the ass is that while I love using Linux, not having WeChat severely limits my communication with some certain family and friends.

So I'm going to try the following:

- [ ] Make a Github repo for this.
- [ ] Do research to see what solutions currently exist.
- [ ] Install WeChat as fast as possible (probably WINE) on an Ubuntu VM 
- [ ] Install WeChat as fast as possible (probably WINE on a *Fedora* VM
- [ ] Figure out how to package WINE into a Flatpak
- [ ] Install WeChat on WINE on a Flatpak
- [ ] Submit it to Flathub
