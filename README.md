# Attempt to Install WeChat on Linux

So I want to figure out how to install WeChat on Linux because one giant pain in the ass is that while I love using Linux, not having WeChat severely limits my communication with some certain family and friends.

So I'm going to try the following:

- [x] Make a Github repo for this.
- [x] Do research to see what solutions currently exist.
  - Some links are below.
  - Not all links have been thoroughly processed.
- [x] ~~Install WeChat as fast as possible (probably WINE) on an Ubuntu VM~~
  - Eh, I've done it before, and honestly it's a pain in the ass.
- [x] ~~Install WeChat as fast as possible (probably WINE) on a *Fedora* VM~~
  - Probably the same issues as before, but also I don't want to dedicate too much space to a VM.
- [ ] Install WeChat in a podman container.
- [ ] Figure out how to package WINE into a Flatpak
- [ ] Install WeChat on WINE on a Flatpak
- [ ] Submit it to Flathub
